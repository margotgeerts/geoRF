#  geoRF: a Geospatial Random Forest :deciduous_tree:

GeoRF is the Python-based code repository for the paper "geoRF: a Geospatial Random Forest". It is a bagged tree ensemble for geospatial data that introduces two split types specifically designed for geospatial features: a diagonal split and a Gaussian split. More information can be found in the paper: [full-text access] (https://rdcu.be/dLlUK).


## Installation

Clone the repository to use the geoRF model.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/margotgeerts/geoRF.git
```

## Usage

```python
from geoRF import GeoRFRegressor

# instantiate GeoRFRegressor
regr = GeoRFRegressor(n_estimators=100, n_jobs=-1)

# train the model, give training data and the column indices of the geospatial features
regr.fit(X_train, y_train, geo_features=[0,1])


```
